- Add a simple health system.
- Add a simple menu screen.
- Add simple sounds.
- Add an inventory system.

- Improve movement and controls.

Maintenance:
- Add the Z level and the Rendering system.
- Implement a start position for player.
- Clean up in constants and settings.json.

- Fix player and enemy walk animation.
- Untie collider size from sprite size.
- Fix scale.
