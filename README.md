# SDL2Game

#TODO:

Stuff to remember:
1. UI
2. Health
3. Shooting tower
4. Containers for UI elements
5. Scene manager to "switch" levels

My plan:
- Add enemy walking animation.
- Add sword attack.
- Add a simple AI system.
- Add a simple health system.
- Add a simple menu screen.
- Add simple sounds.
- Add an inventory system.
- Add skills.
- Add rotate to Transform
- Fix colliders (use the velocity vector?)
- Improve movement and controls.

Maintenance:
- Add the Z level.
- Implement a start position for player.
- Clean up in constants and settings.json.
- Move libraries to the game folder.
- Clean up in SpriteComponent - remove magic numbers.
